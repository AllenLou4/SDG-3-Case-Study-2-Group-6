                at the patients emails and wants an application to manage inquiries 
                to be efficient and convenient.
            </p>
            <h4>Behavioral Segmentation:</h4>
            <p>Regardless of the price, the patients will still go to the nutritionist
                 as it is mandatory for them to take care of themselves for health purposes, 
                 and the things Eugenia does can also be made online like consultations for 
                 the patients convenience

                much and she thinks her job can be extended online especially even in the post 
                pandemic with greater technologies she thinks it can be done.
